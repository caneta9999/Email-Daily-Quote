This code is used to send a quote every day via email. <br/>
I made this project to test certain things like sending emails and scheduling tasks. <br/> 
[ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt) helped me a lot to make this code, so credits to the AI. <br/>
Thanks also to this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDPQfj4bZY8) for the lesson. I watched to understand how to schedule using Python <br/>
The image used can be found [here](https://pixabay.com/pt/photos/risonho-emoticon-raiva-bravo-2979107/) and the API used to fetch quotes was [ZenQuotes](https://zenquotes.io/). I thank them. <br/>
The project has two codes, the main script, used to send the email and the second script, used to prevent it from running on OS startup.
